                    <br />
                    <br /> Cryptocurrency is a decentralized form of digital
                    currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike
                    traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies are not
                    controlled by any central authority, such as a government or
                    a bank. Instead, they operate on blockchain technology, a
                    distributed ledger that records all transactions securely
                    and transparently.
